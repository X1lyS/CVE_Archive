# CVE-2025-29180
## [CVE ID]
CVE-2025-29180

## [PRODUCT]
FOXCMS

## [VERSION]
<=1.25

## [PROBLEM TYPE]
SQL Injection (Time-Based Blind)

## [DESCRIPTION]
In FOXCMS version 1.25 and earlier, the installdb.php file contains a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability. The url_prefix, domain, and my_website POST parameters are directly concatenated into SQL statements without proper filtering. Attackers can exploit this by injecting malicious SQL code containing time-delay functions like SLEEP() through these parameters. By observing response times, attackers can infer database information, including database names, table structures, and other sensitive data, potentially leading to full database compromise.
