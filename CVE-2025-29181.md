# CVE-2025-29181
## [CVE ID]
CVE-2025-29181

## [PRODUCT]
FOXCMS

## [VERSION]
<=1.25

## [PROBLEM TYPE]
SQL Injection

## [DESCRIPTION]
FOXCMS version 1.25 and earlier is vulnerable to SQL injection via the $param['title'] parameter in /admin/util/Field.php. The parameter is obtained from user input without proper sanitization and directly concatenated into SQL statements in the GetFieldMake method. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary SQL commands, modify database structure, and access sensitive information. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and can lead to both information disclosure and code execution.
